/*
You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.

Input Format
- Functions
    X : Integer
    Y : Integer

Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.

Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. 
List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.

Sample Input
X       Y
20      20
20      20
20      21
23      22
22      23
21      20

Sample Output
20 20
20 21
22 23
