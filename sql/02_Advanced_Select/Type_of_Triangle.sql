/*
Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

Explanation
Values in the tuple (20,20,23) form an Isosceles triangle, because A==B.
Values in the tuple (20,20,20) form an Equilateral triangle, because A==B==C. 
Values in the tuple (20,21,22) form a Scalene triangle, because A<>B<>C.
Values in the tuple (13,14,30) cannot form a triangle because the combined value of sides A and B is not larger than that of side C.

    B : Integer
    C : Integer
